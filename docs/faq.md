# FAQ

## 1. **What makes you the perfect candidate for a Senior DevOps Engineer role? Can you please describe the various activities you were involved extensively as part of the role?**

    My six years of DevOps engagement have equipped me with a skill set that I believe matches the role's expectations. I have extensive experience in automating cloud infrastructure across Azure and AWS, as well as managing Kubernetes clusters and workloads. My work in setting up CI/CD pipelines and implementing GitOps strategies has been driven by a commitment to creating reliable and sustainable systems.

    Incorporating security measures from the early stages of process development has been a key focus of mine, especially with the integration of DevSecOps practices. My background in software development has been invaluable in understanding how to integrate these security practices throughout the development lifecycle.

    Having completed a Postgraduate course in Data Science, I've applied DevOps principles to data-centric environments, involving DataOps and MLOps projects. Moreover, my tenure as a Big Data Engineer in Germany provided me with practical experience with Kafka. Nowadays, I pursue great interest in continuing working and learning more about this intersection between DevOps and Data Science, so I’m really excited to be part of the team.

    My role has also extended to performance monitoring and optimization, employing tools like Prometheus and Grafana to gain insights into system behavior and resource utilization. This data-driven approach has been key in making informed decisions to optimize performance and scalability.

    Further, my background in software development has empowered me to understand the nuances of the software lifecycle, enabling me to contribute to the planning and execution of projects from conception to production in a way that aligns development and operations for better outcomes.

## 2. **How many years of cloud experience do you have?**

    I have been working with both cloud providers for over 6 years, mostly with Azure. I'm currently aiming for the AWS Solutions Architect certification to deepen my knowledge. 

## 3. **Do you have prior experience in DevSecOps or Cloud Operations role?**

    Incorporating security measures from the early stages of process development has been a key focus of mine, especially with the integration of DevSecOps practices. My background in software development has been invaluable in understanding how to integrate these security practices throughout the development lifecycle.

## 4. Do you have programming/scripting experience in any one of these (python, bash, PowerShell)?**

    I've been using UNIX-based systems for more than 20 years, so I know my way around Bash scripting and Linux server administration pretty well. I also learned a lot of Python when I took my post-graduate course in Data Science, so I can write complex Python scripts too. Furthermore, In my last two projects, I worked extensively with Windows Servers, and that's where I picked up Powershell, have gotten good at using it, and sometimes I think it's even better than Bash.

## 5. What's your experience with Windows Servers?
    
    In my last project, I worked a lot with Windows Servers and handled a mix of .NET applications. Some were built using the newer .NET Core, while others were on ASP.NET version 4.
    
    We set up a self-hosted Octopus Deploy on a Kubernetes cluster, which we created using Terraform. This helped us manage the deployment of our apps to the Windows Servers and the Kubernetes clusters smoothly.

## 5. What's your experience with Kubernetes?

    I've been working with Kubernetes for six years now and have gotten pretty comfortable with it. I've done a fair bit with continuous deployment using CI/CD tools and GitOps, and have also set up monitoring systems using Datadog, Prometheus, and Grafana to keep an eye on things.
    
    On the security side, I got to work with DevSecOps tools like Trivy to make sure everything was up to snuff. For GitOps, I used FluxCD and ArgoCD to help automate our deployments, which made things a lot more reliable.
    
    I also got to play around with Service Mesh using Istio, which was great for managing microservices communication. I had some fun testing out Canary Deployments with Flagger to make our release process safer and smoother.
    
    You can find some DevOps projects including one specific for GitOps CD that bootstraps FluxCD to a Kubernetes Cluster to create a rich DevOps environment comprised of monitoring, continuous deployment, automation, container orchestration, infrastructure as code, as well as some SRE insights.

## 6. What's your experience with cloud-native apps?

    All of the projects I worked on involved a strong focus on cloud-native apps, particularly using microservices architecture to enhance scalability and resilience. Leveraging container orchestration with Kubernetes, I ensured seamless deployment and management of microservice-based applications across AWS and Azure environments. To showcase this ability, I am currently developing this cloud-native [Golang app](github.com/guirgouveia/go-vuejs-microservices) and you can see that along with the deployment, I'm also developing the containerization and container orchestration files. This app still needs to be decoupled into microservices.  
        
    On Azure, I've utilized AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) for orchestrating containers, employed Azure Functions for event-driven, serverless compute scenarios, and managed state with Azure Cosmos DB's globally distributed database service. For storage solutions, I've implemented Azure Blob Storage for its high durability and availability. My infrastructure as code approach was facilitated through Terraform and Azure Resource Manager templates, and I've harnessed the power of Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions to create robust CI/CD pipelines that enhance and support microservices deployments seamlessly.

    On AWS, I orchestrated container deployment and management using Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), leveraged AWS Lambda for serverless application execution, and managed data consistency and replication across microservices with Amazon DynamoDB. For object storage and backup, I've utilized Amazon S3 for its scalability and data availability. Infrastructure as code was streamlined through Terraform and AWS CloudFormation, allowing me to define and provision AWS infrastructure efficiently. To automate and enhance the deployment process, I employed AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild for continuous integration and delivery tailored to microservices architecture

## 7. Can you share your experience with implementing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines? What tools and methodologies have you used in this context?

    I've worked with many tools for CICD pipeline development and currently, I've been adopting GitOps workflows more often. These tools include Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, FluxCD and ArgoCD.
