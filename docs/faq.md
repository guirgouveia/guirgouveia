## 1. **How many years of experience do you have in DevOps role? Can you please describe the various activities you were involved extensively as part of the role?**

    My six years of DevOps engagement have equipped me with a skill set that I believe matches the role's expectations. I have extensive experience in automating cloud infrastructure across Azure and AWS, as well as managing Kubernetes clusters and workloads. My work in setting up CI/CD pipelines and implementing GitOps strategies has been driven by a commitment to creating reliable and sustainable systems.

    Incorporating security measures from the early stages of process development has been a key focus of mine, especially with the integration of DevSecOps practices. My background in software development has been invaluable in understanding how to integrate these security practices throughout the development lifecycle.

    Having completed a Postgraduate course in Data Science, I've applied DevOps principles to data-centric environments, involving DataOps and MLOps projects. Moreover, my tenure as a Big Data Engineer in Germany provided me with practical experience with Kafka. Nowadays, I pursue great interest in continuing working and learning more about this intersection between DevOps and Data Science, so I’m really excited to be part of the team.

    My role has also extended to performance monitoring and optimization, employing tools like Prometheus and Grafana to gain insights into system behavior and resource utilization. This data-driven approach has been key in making informed decisions to optimize performance and scalability.

    Further, my background in software development has empowered me to understand the nuances of the software lifecycle, enabling me to contribute to the planning and execution of projects from conception to production in a way that aligns development and operations for better outcomes.

## 2. **How many years of cloud experience do you have?**

    I have been working with both cloud providers for over 6 years, mostly with Azure. I'm currently aiming for the AWS Solutions Architect certification to deepen my knowledge. 

## 3. **Do you have prior experience in DevSecOps or Cloud Operations role?**

    Incorporating security measures from the early stages of process development has been a key focus of mine, especially with the integration of DevSecOps practices. My background in software development has been invaluable in understanding how to integrate these security practices throughout the development lifecycle.

## 4. Do you have programming/scripting experience in any one of these (python, bash, powershell)?**

    I've been using UNIX-based systems for more than 20 years, so I know my way around Bash scripting and Linux server administration pretty well. I also learned a lot of Python when I took my post-graduate course in Data Science, so I can write complex Python scripts too. Furthermore, In my last two projects, I worked extensively with Windows Servers, and that's where I picked up Powershell, have gotten good at using it, and sometimes I think it's even better than Bash.
